# Deepfake-Audio-Recognition

## Background
The advent of machine learning led to increased innovation. In most cases this is a good thing however, there are people who use this  for their own benefit and in the process harm others. 

This project is centered on identifying the difference between  ones actual voice and a trained machine learning voice. With the use of voice recognition to access banking services or to authenticate oneself on the rise, we would like to create a system that will be able to identify deepfakes and avert the risk of people being able to access each otherâ€™s personal information. The project will be an extension of Jemine, Corentin works, who provided a vocoder that is able to clone human speech in realtime.

## Objectives
The main objective will be to detect the difference between real and computer generated voices and correctly classify them. 

### Specific Objectives:  
- To replicate an audio synthesizer
- To get the synthesizer to work with Swahili typed text
- To identify characteristics of deep fakes vs those of natural audio
